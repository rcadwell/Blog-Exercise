    <h3>The Origins of Extreme Metal</h3>
    <p>The origins of extreme metal can be traced back to the late 1960s with the legendary <b>Black Sabbath</b> establishing the metal genre and sound. It wasn't until the late 1970s that extreme metal reared its ugly head with bands like <b>Venom</b> and <b>Mercyful Fate</b>. These bands took what Black Sabbath did and brought it to the next level.</p>
    <h3>Thrash Metal</h3>
    <img class="article-img" src="https://pictures.skullsnbones.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/metallica1986.jpg">
    <p>Thrash metal is what many consider to be the very first extreme metal subgenre because it took elements of hardcore punk and combined them with the sounds of the <em>New Wave of British Heavy Metal</em>. <b>Metallica</b> was the first thrash band to be signed to a label and they put the Bay Area on the map in the 1980s, thereby globalizing thrash. 
      The East Coast scene with bands like <b>Anthrax</b> and <b>Overkill</b> brought in a lot of <em>East Coast hardcore punk</em> that gave their songs an extra speedy and aggressive feel, whereas the Bay Area scene focused more on technicality. 
      <em>The German teutonic scene</em> with bands like <b>Sodom</b>, <b>Destruction</b>, and <b>Kreator</b> were a bit heavier in their approach with darker subject matter, especially with the echoing effects of World War 2 on that continent and war being a big influence on that specific sound. The thrash scene grew to arena size levels making way for new styles to take over the underground.</p>

    <h3>Death Metal</h3>

    <p>Death metal started in the mid 1980s with no holds barred and the first band to bridge thrash with a faster and more brutal approach was <b>Possessed</b>. <b>Possessed</b> laid the ground work and the band, <b>Death</b>, really brought the brutality with full force by introducing guttural vocals and technical riffs thanks to Chuck Schuldiner, the godfather of death metal. 
      The American death metal scene started in Florida and spread like wildfire and other countries all had their own sound and lyrical themes. 
      The Scandinavian bands brought in melody with keyboards and guitar lines that you can sing that gave the music a different atmosphere. These bands also had lyrics that dealt more with personal and existential themes and not just horror lyrics.
      <b>Death</b> was the first American death metal band that really branched out from horror themes and brought in philosophical themes mid-career while going full on progressive and other bands were still brutal but the sound was evolving. As death metal was becoming more polished with the production, that turned off a lot of fans and various bands, which only helped to create a new, rebellious movement for people that wanted a more raw sound.</p>

    <h3>Black Metal</h3>

    <p>Black metal was a reaction to what was going on in the overall metal scene, containing shrieking vocals and raw production with a focus on the cold atmosphere, essentially making it the punk rock of metal. The black metal scene exploded in Norway, with artists taking a lot of inspiration from bands like <b>Venom</b> and <b>Mercyful Fate</b>. 
      <em>Norwegian black metal</em> is also very controversial because of various members burning churches and killing rival band members but these things did not stop the growth of the scene. <b>Bathory</b> was the first true black metal band, essentially inventing the standard black metal riff as well as the right atmosphere for the music, with <b>Mayhem</b> expanding and really defining the sound. 
      <b>Emperor</b> was a bigger band apart of the <em>Second Wave of Black Metal</em> and they introduced symphonic sounds because they didn't just want to stick to the raw production.
      Black metal is also the one extreme metal subgenre that has helped create various other scenes with niche sounds, such as blackgaze, symphonic black metal, and blackened thrash, with the overall scene still going strong.
